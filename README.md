# Overview of Project
##Purpose
THe purpose of this project was to collect stock imformation for the years 2017 and 2018 to determine if the stocks are worth investing in. We completed this by using Microsoft Excel VBA, However to make the code more efficent the code needed to be refactored 
##Data
The data we used came from a excel workbook containg stock imformation for both years, 2017 and 2018. The goal with this was to retrive the ticker, the total daily volume and the return of each stock.
#Analysis
##Results
The oringinal code used found the ticker, total daily volume, and return for each stock which can be run with the use of the buttons added to the workbokk, the worksheet can also be cleared. In this code we also added formatting for the table and color coded it to show positive returns (green) and negative returns (red). ![This is an image]![Table 2017](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89491163/178613937-ca0a2b59-09ad-4baa-abeb-98546314f3c1.png). ![This is an image]![Table 2018](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89491163/178614081-af2e66b4-cf16-4c8f-8fdd-08908d2c614e.png)
In these tables we can see the retuns in green are positive and the returns in red are negative
#Pros and Cons of refactoring code
##Pros
After refactoring our code it looks at lot cleanier making it easier to debug and to read. The most significant benefit from refactoring the code was a quicker run time for our macros as seen in theses images ![This is an image]![VBA_Challenge_2017](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89491163/178614476-7bc08b99-a47c-43e2-a7bc-7648cbd22912.png) ![This is an image]![VBA_Challenge_2018](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89491163/178614591-f32c97bc-ab10-4bbb-9bba-1fce174860c6.png)
